**[The future of open source is still very much in flux](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/17/1077498/future-open-source/)**

What I find most interesting is the discussion around the growing use of open-source projects. While open-source software has long been seen as a community-driven endeavor by software engineers all around the world, the increasing role of big tech raises questions about the balance between corporate interests and the core principles of openness and collaboration which I believes is what made softwares so amazing in the first. Due to the fact that many popular softwares like Linux, Git, etc were open source which deeply contributed to the tech world. The article presents a thought-provoking look at how big tech companies should further embrace open source in order for the tech industry to stay as strong as it is.
