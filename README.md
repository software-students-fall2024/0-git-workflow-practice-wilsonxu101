**[The future of open source is still very much in flux](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/17/1077498/future-open-source/)**

What I find most interesting is the discussion around the growing use of open-source projects. While open-source software has long been seen as a community-driven endeavor by software engineers all around the world, the increasing role of big tech raises questions about the balance between corporate interests and the core principles of openness and collaboration which I believes is what made softwares so amazing in the first. Due to the fact that many popular softwares like Linux, Git, etc were open source which deeply contributed to the tech world. The article presents a thought-provoking look at how big tech companies should further embrace open source in order for the tech industry to stay as strong as it is.

I'm not actually super familiar with how open source works so this was really enlightening! I think it's really interesting that there is a dilemma about how to structure these giant open source projects, and it's interesting that as it gets bigger and more demanding for the volunteers to maintain (thereby making it especially important that they get compensated for their work), that it almost becomes just another big tech company. As I was reading, I became curious about how these decisions (about structure, compensation) even get made and how do those decision-makers get picked to be in their positions in the first place. The article does a really wonderful job outlining the complicated nuances of making code "open"--how do you preserve that openness while preventing supposed misuse of the code and making sure it can be sustainably maintained and improved on, without imposing some corporate body to govern it and manage it?
